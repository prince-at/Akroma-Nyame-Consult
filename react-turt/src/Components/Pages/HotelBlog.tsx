<hr/>
    <h1 className="global-text">📍 Location Is Everything</h1>
    <h1 className="work-abroad-title">Before you hit "Book Now", double-check the hotel’s location. Is it close to the city center, airport, public transport, or key attractions? A cheaper hotel far from everything might cost you more in taxi fares and lost time.

</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h1 className="global-text">💸 Compare Prices (and Look for Deals)</h1>
    <h1 className="work-abroad-title">Use hotel comparison websites or booking platforms to get a sense of the going rate. Don’t forget to check the hotel’s own website — they sometimes offer exclusive discounts, free upgrades, or loyalty points.




</h1>
<hr/>
    <h1 className="global-text">🛏️ Read Reviews — Not Just the Stars</h1>
    <h1 className="work-abroad-title">Star ratings can be useful, but real guest reviews tell the full story. Look for reviews that mention cleanliness, staff friendliness, Wi-Fi strength, and breakfast quality. Avoid reviews that are outdated or overly emotional — balance is key.
</h1>
<hr/>
    <h1 className="global-text">🧾 Check What’s Included</h1>
    <h1 className="work-abroad-title">Some hotels charge extra for things you’d expect to be free — like parking, Wi-Fi, or even using the gym. Always read the fine print and make sure you know what’s included in your rate.</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h1 className="global-text">🕒 Pay Attention to Check-In and Check-Out Times</h1>
    <h1 className="work-abroad-title">Make sure the hotel’s check-in/check-out policy fits your travel plans. Arriving too early or leaving too late? See if they offer luggage storage or early check-in/late check-out options.</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h1 className="global-text">🔐 Book Through Secure Channels</h1>
    <h1 className="work-abroad-title">Always use reputable booking platforms or the hotel’s official website. Avoid third-party sites with sketchy reviews or no customer support. And double-check the cancellation policy before you pay.
You won’t just come home with credits. You’ll come home with unforgettable stories, global insight, and a whole new version of yourself.</h1>
    
    <hr/>
    <h1 className="global-text">📞 Don’t Be Afraid to Call the Hotel</h1>
    <h1 className="work-abroad-title">Want a better room? Need an early check-in? Hotels often offer more flexibility when you call directly. It's also a good way to confirm your reservation and make special requests.</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h1 className="global-text">✅ Final Thoughts</h1>
    <h1 className="work-abroad-title">Booking a hotel doesn’t need to be a hassle — it just requires a little planning. With the right research and a few smart decisions, you can find the perfect stay for your trip, whether it's a 5-star resort or a cozy budget-friendly room.
